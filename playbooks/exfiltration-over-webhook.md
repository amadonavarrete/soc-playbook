## Playbook: Exfiltration Over Webhook
    
### MITRE

| Tactic | Technique ID | Technique Name | Sub-Technique Name | Platforms | Permissions Required |
| ------ | ------------ | -------------- | ------------------ |---------- |--------------------- |
|Exfiltration|T1567.004|Exfiltration Over Web Service|Exfiltration Over Webhook|ESXi, Linux, Office Suite, SaaS, Windows, macOS|Direct access to webhook endpoint|


```
(P) Preparation

1. Monitor webhook usage.
2. Block commonly abused webhook domains and inspect DNS queries for anomalies.
3. Set up rules to detect beaconing or unusual exfiltration.
4. Deploy DLP tools to inspect outbound content for sensitive data.
5. Utilize firewalls/proxies to limit outbound HTTP/HTTPS to approved domains/IPs.
6. Disable script execution where necessary.
7. Never hardcode webhook URLs in scripts or code repositories.
8. Educate developers and users on the risk of exposing webhooks and how to secure them.

Assign steps to individuals or teams to work concurrently, when possible; this playbook is not purely sequential. Use your best judgment.

### Investigate

#### Key Questions
- What process or user initiated the webhook request?
- What type of data was transmitted and to which external service?
- Has this behavior occurred elsewhere in the environment?

1. Search for outbound HTTP/HTTPS `POST` requests to webhook-related domains.
2. Check browser history, shell history, and running processes.
3. Review PCAPs/proxy logs for data patterns and frequency.
4. Inspect any scripts, binaries, or files that generated the traffic.
5. Look for similar indicators across peer systems.

### Remediate

* **Plan remediation events** where these steps are launched together (or in coordinated fashion), with appropriate teams ready to respond to any disruption.
* **Consider the timing and tradeoffs** of remediation actions: your response has consequences.

#### Contain

1. **Isolate the affected host**
   - Immediately quarantine the host to prevent further exfiltration or lateral movement.
   - Conduct an initial triage to assess the scope of the exfiltration attempt.
2. **Block outbound webhook domains/IPs**
   - Add known malicious webhook URLs or IPs to blocklists.
4. **Revoke webhook access (if internal)**
   - Invalidate or delete exposed webhook URLs and rotate any associated secrets.
   - Audit webhook configurations and permissions to ensure no further unauthorized access exists.

#### Eradicate

1. **Remove malicious artifacts**
   - Scan and remove malicious scripts, binaries, or scheduled tasks used for webhook-based exfiltration.
   - Validate that all known IOCs are purged from the system.
2. **Disable compromised accounts or credentials**
   - Disable or reset accounts involved in the compromise, especially if credentials were used to access webhook endpoints.
   - Review access logs to ensure no further unauthorized usage occurred before disabling.
3. **Clear persistence mechanisms**
   - Identify and remove persistence techniques such as startup entries, scheduled tasks, or registry changes.
4. **Reimage if necessary**
   - If system integrity is questionable, initiate a secure reimage of the affected asset.
   - Restore from a trusted, validated image and apply all security updates post-restoration.

### Communicate

*Refer to organization's Incident Response Communication Plan for escalation matrix, timing, and format.*

### Recover

In addition to the general steps and guidance in the incident response plan:
1. **Restore endpoint integrity**
   - Reimage compromised systems or verify full cleanup using deep scans and hash validation.
   - Apply latest patches and configurations before reconnecting to the production network.
2. **Reset credentials and secrets**
   - Rotate compromised credentials, webhook tokens, and API keys across impacted services.
   - Notify impacted teams and ensure updated credentials are stored securely.
3. **Reinstate blocked services safely**
   - Gradually re-enable disabled services after security validation and formal IR team approval.
   - Conduct service-specific risk assessments before restoring full access.
4. **Verify monitoring coverage**
   - Confirm telemetry and alerts are active for similar threat patterns and exfiltration attempts.
   - Test detection rules and logging pipelines to confirm effectiveness.
5. **Conduct system validation**
   - Run post-recovery scans to confirm systems are secure and compliant.
   - Document validation outcomes and update asset tracking with recovery status.

### Lessons Learned

1. Confirm all systems are functioning securely.
2. Conduct a formal post-incident review with all stakeholders.
3. Revise playbooks, detection rules, and incident response plans.
4. Inform affected users of the resolution and any follow-up steps.
5. Submit post-incident reports to regulatory bodies, if applicable.
6. Enhance SIEM rules, SOAR playbooks, and alert thresholds based on incident findings.
