![SOC Playbook Banner](resources/images/soc-playbook-banner.png)

A collection of structured incident response playbooks designed for SOC analysts. <br><br>
This project was created to gain hands-on experience in researching, writing, and maintaining structured response guides based on real-world threat scenarios. Each playbook maps to specific [MITRE ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/) techniques and focuses on common alert types found in enterprise environments.
